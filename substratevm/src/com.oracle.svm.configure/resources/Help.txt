GraalVM native-image-configure tool

This tool can be used to prepare a configuration of JNI, reflection and
resources for a native-image build.

Usage: native-image-configure process-trace [options] tracefile...
       native-image-configure help

process-trace             processes trace file(s) from the agent.
    --reflect-output=<path>
                          write a reflection configuration file with the given
                          path. This file can be later provided to native-image
                          with -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=<path>.
    --jni-output=<path>
                          write a JNI configuration file with the given path.
                          This file can be later provided to native-image with
                          -H:JNIConfigurationFiles=<path>.
    --proxy-output=<path>
                          write a dynamic proxy configuration file at the given
                          path. This file can be later provided to native-image
                          with -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationFiles=<path>.
    --resource-output=<path>
                          write a configuration file containing used resources
                          (getResource) with the given path. This file can be
                          later provided to native-image with
                          -H:ResourceConfigurationFiles=<path>.
                          The paths in the configuration file might need to be
                          adjusted for the build directories/classpath.
    --no-filter
                          usage of JNI, reflection and resources in internal
                          classes does not have to be configured for builds
                          with native-image and by default, is excluded from
                          the generated configurations. This option disables
                          this filter.

help                      prints this help message.

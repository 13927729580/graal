# T-Trace: The Ultimate Tracing and Insights Gathering Platform

*For release in Feb 2020*

OracleLabs proudly presents **T-Trace** - the ultimate multi-language,
multi-instrument, multi-purpose tracing and insights gathering framework for
*GraalVM* based on *Truffle* polyglot API and its instrumentation technology.

**T-Trace** is multipurpose, flexible tool that greatly reduces 
the effort of writing reliable microservices solutions. The dynamic nature
of **T-Trace** helps everyone to selectively apply complex tracing
pointcuts on already deployed applications running at full speed. 
**T-Trace** further blurs the difference between various DevOps tasks -
code once, apply your insights anytime, anywhere!

## Tracing in any Language and any Framework

The traditional tracing solution requires every developer to modify own code 
with manually added traces. **T-Trace** brings such experience to another 
level by using the powerful instrumentation capabilities built 
into any GraalVM language (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R)
and letting you dynamically apply the tracing when needed, without altering the
original code of the application at all. All GraalVM languages and technologies 
are designed with support for tracing in mind. 
Apply the **T-Trace** insights to scripts running in *node.js* or
*Ruby on Rails* or your *Python* big data computation pipeline. All of that
is possible and ready to be explored.

GraalVM comes with a unified set of prepackaged high performance **T-Trace** 
insights at your convenience. In addition to that one can easily create own
**T-Trace** insights in a language of one's choice. The insights are well
crafted code that, when enabled, gets automatically spread around the codebase 
of one's application and is applied at critical tracing pointcuts.
The code is smoothly blended into bussiness code of the application 
enriching the core functionality with additional cross cutting concerns
(for example security).

## Excellent for Research

While existing GraalVM **T-Trace** insights scripts are primarily targeted
towards ease of use in microservices area, the functionality of **T-Trace**
pointcuts isn't limited to such area at all!

**T-Trace** is an ideal tool for practicing *aspects oriented programming*
in a completely language agnostic way. **T-Trace** insights allow detailed
access to runtime behavior of a program at all possible pointcuts allowing one to
inspect values, types at invocation or allocation sites, gathering useful information
and collecting and presenting it in unrestricted ways. The **T-Trace** insights
allow one to modify computed values, interrupt execution and 
quickly experiment with behavioral changes without modifying the
application code.

**T-Trace** framework brings powerful cross-language yet language agnostic
metaprogramming features into hands of every researcher and practitioner.

## Ready for production

GraalVM languages are well known for running with excellent performance and **T-Trace** 
makes no compromises to that! Your applications are inherently ready for
tracing without giving up any speed. Launch your application 
as you are used to. Let it run at full speed. When needed, connect to its GraalVM
and enable requested **T-Trace** insights. Their code gets automatically
blended into the code of your application, making them a natural part
of surrounding code. There is no loss of performance compared to code that
would be manually tweaked to contain the insights at appropriate places, but
such modification doesn't have to be done in advance - it can be fully applied
only when needed.

GraalVM provides powerful tools to help you write, debug, manage, and organize
your **T-Trace** insights scripts. It is a matter of pressing a single button
to enable selected **T-Trace** insight and a matter of another click to 
disable it cleanly, returning the application to state prior to the use
of the insight.

Industry well known tools like
*VisualVM* has been enhanced to provide a unified view of locally as well as
remotely running applications and the **T-Trace** insights dynamically 
applied to each of them. Enlist available *HotSpot* or *native-image* based
virtual machines. Connect to them on demand. Apply selected insights. Let
them gather their data. Obtain the data and analysis them with the integrated
graphical tools. Disable the insights and disconnect. Let the application run
at the original full speed.

The flexibility and the power of standard as well as hand written
**T-Trace** insights makes them an excellent choice for vendors of cloud
based offerings. There is no other system that could compete with the 
multi-language offerings of GraalVM. The ability to create custom **T-Trace** 
based insights in any language brings the combined offering to yet another level.
GraalVM with **T-Trace** is the dream come true for anyone seeking security,
embeddablity, configurability, robustness and performance at the cloud scale.

## Available now!

Support for **T-Trace** tracing and insights gathering platform is an 
integral part of GraalVM 20.0.1 version. Download at http://graalvm.org
and experience the beauty of **T-Trace** based analysis with your own senses.
Gathering information about local or distant, large and fast big data workloads
has never been easier!

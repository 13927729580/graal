# T-Trace: The Ultimate Tracing and Insights Gathering Platform

*For release in Feb 2020*

OracleLabs proudly presents **T-Trace** - the ultimate multi-language,
multi-instrument, multi-purpose tracing and insights gathering framework for
*GraalVM* based on *Truffle* polyglot API and its instrumentation technology.

**T-Trace** is multipurpose, flexible tool that greatly reduces 
the effort of writing reliable microservices solutions. The dynamic nature
of **T-Trace** helps everyone to selectively apply complex tracing
pointcuts on already deployed applications running at full speed. 
**T-Trace** further blurs the difference between various DevOps tasks -
code once, apply your insights anytime, anywhere!

## Tracing in any Language and any Framework

The traditional tracing solution requires every developer to modify own code 
with manually added traces. **T-Trace** brings such experience to another 
level by using the powerful instrumentation capabilities built 
into any GraalVM language (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R)
and letting you dynamically apply the tracing when needed, without altering the
original code of the application at all.

All GraalVM languages and technologies are designed with support for *T-Tracing*
in mind. Apply the **T-Trace** insights to scripts running in *node.js* or
*Ruby on Rails* or your *Python* big data computation pipeline. All of that
is possible and ready for your exploration.

GraalVM provides a unified set of prepared high performance **T-Trace** 
insights at your convenice. In addition to that one can easily create own
**T-Trace** insights in a language of one's choice. The insights are well
crafted code that, when enabled, are automatically spread around codebase 
of one's application and applied at critical tracing pointcuts.
They are smoothly blended into bussiness code of the application 
enriching the core functionality with additional cross cutting concerns.

## Excellent for research

While existing GraalVM **T-Trace** insights scripts are primarily targeted
towards ease of use in microservices area, the functionality of **T-Trace**
pointcuts isn't limited to such area at all!

**T-Trace** is an ideal tool for practicing *aspects oriented programming*
in a completely language agnostic way. **T-Trace** insights allow detailed
access to runtime behavior of a program at all possible pointcuts allowing one to
inspect values, types at invocation or allocation sites, gathering useful information
and collecting and presenting it an unrestricted ways. The **T-Trace** insights
allow one to modify computed value and quickly experiement with behavioral
changes without modifying the application code at all.

**T-Trace** framework brings powerful cross-language yet language agnostic
metaprogramming features at your hands.

## Ready for production

GraalVM languages are well known for running with full performance and **T-Trace** 
makes no compromises to that! Your applications are inherently ready for
*T-Tracing* without loss of any performance. Enabling **T-Trace** insights
blends them into the code of your application, making them a natural part
of surrounding code. There is no loss of performance compared to manual modification
of applications code.

GraalVM provides powerful tools to help you write, debug, manage, organize and 
activate your **T-Trace** insights scripts. Industry well known tools like
*VisualVM* has been enhanced to provide a unified view of locally as well as
remotely running applications and the **T-Trace** insights dynamically 
applied to each of them.
